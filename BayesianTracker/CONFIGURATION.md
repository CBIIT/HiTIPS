# Guide to `btrack` configuration parameters

This is a short guide to the configuration parameters for `btrack`

## Miscellaneous parameters
+ `max_search_radius` - the maximum search radius in isotropic unit of the data
+ `mode` - the update mode for the tracker
+ `volume` - estimate of the dimensions of the imaging volume

+ `name` - this is the name of the model
+ `measurements` - the number of measurements of the system (e.g. x, y, z)
+ `states` - the number of states of the system (typically >= measurements)
+ `A` - State transition matrix
+ `B` - Control matrix
+ `H` - Observation matrix
+ `P` - Initial covariance estimate
+ `Q` - Estimated error in process
+ `R` - Estimated error in measurements
+ `accuracy` - integration limits for calculating the probabilities
+ `dt` - time difference, always 1
+ `max_lost` - number of frames without observation before marking a track as lost
+ `prob_not_assign` - the default probability to not assign a track
+ `sigma` - a scalar multiplication factor used for each matrix

## Hypothesis model

Below is an example of a configuration for the global optimizer.

```json
"HypothesisModel": {
  "name": "cell_hypothesis",
  "hypotheses": ["P_FP", "P_init", "P_term", "P_link", "P_branch", "P_dead"],
  "lambda_time": 5.0,
  "lambda_dist": 5.0,
  "lambda_link": 5.0,
  "lambda_branch": 5.0,
  "eta": 1e-150,
  "theta_dist": 5.0,
  "theta_time": 5.0,
  "dist_thresh": 10,
  "time_thresh": 3,
  "apop_thresh": 2,
  "segmentation_miss_rate": 0.1,
  "apoptosis_rate": 0.1,
  "relax": false
}
```

The parameters are, as follows:
* `name` - this is the name of the model
* `hypotheses` - this is a list of hypotheses to generate for the optimizer
* `lambda_time` - a scaling factor for the influence of time when determining initialization or termination hypotheses
* `lambda_dist` - a scaling factor for the influence of distance at the border when determining initialization or termination hypotheses
* `lambda_link` - a scaling factor for the influence of track-to-track distance on linking probability
* `lambda_branch` - a scaling factor for the influence of cell state and position on division (mitosis/branching) probability
* `eta` - default low probability
* `theta_dist` - a threshold (in pixels) for the distance from the edge of the FOV to add an initialization or termination hypothesis
* `theta_time` - a threshold (in frames) for the time from the beginning or end of movie to add an initialization or termination hypothesis
* `dist_thresh` - bin size for considering hypotheses
* `time_thresh` - bin size for considering hypotheses
* `apop_thresh` - number of apoptotic detections, counted consecutively from the back of the track, to be considered a real apoptosis
* `segmentation_miss_rate` - miss rate for the segmentation, e.g. 1/100 segmentations incorrect = 0.01
* `apoptosis_rate` - rate of apoptosis detections
* `relax` - disables the `theta_dist` and `theta_time` thresholds to create termination and intialization hypotheses
